Developed a dynamic lift simulation using React, JavaScript, and CSS. Implemented flexible configurations for number of buildings, lifts, and floors. The lift moves between floors based on floor requests or lift requests and updates its position to provide a visual representation of its current location. Additionally, the simulation features a maintenance mode to represent lifts under maintenance.
